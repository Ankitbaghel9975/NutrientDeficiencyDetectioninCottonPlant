# Nutrient-Deficiency-Detection-in-Cotton-Plant-
This repository presents a novel deep learning approach for early and accurate detection of nutrient deficiencies in cotton plants. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on visual inspection, this project integrates analysis of plant image patterns with real-time environmental data to provide a more robust and context-aware diagnosis.
